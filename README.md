# Traveller-- A Travel Accounting Tool with Weather Display and Restaurant Recommendations
I developed a Travel Accounting Tool using Python, featuring an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enhance usability. This tool is designed to assist users in managing their travel finances efficiently while offering nearby restaurant recommendations and weather updates to enhance their overall travel experience.

# Usage
## Login
You can run the `LoginPage.py` to start at the login page. Before logging in, make sure to sign up first. When you click the sign-up button, the system creates a CSV file to store your username and a hashed password.

## Main Page
After logging in, the main page will appear, featuring three sections: Weather, Expense, and Restaurants. You can click on any of them to proceed.

## Weather Page
You can search for the weather of a specific city in a specific country, or click `Get weather from current location` to view the weather at your current location

## Expense Page
You can manually record expenses during the trip. Click `Summary` to view the financial data

## Restaurants Page
You can find restaurants within 2000 meters of your current location and view their ratings and addresses.

# Warning
**I obtained the restaurant search API through Google. This API is not free, and additional requests will incur charges.Please obtain the restaurant search API by yourself.**

# Reminder
I've uploaded a video that demonstrates how the tool works. Please check `How to use the tool.mp4`.
